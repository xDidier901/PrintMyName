# PrintMyName

Easy project to get you started with pull requests and get participations for the HacktoberFest event

# Create a pull request

If you don't know how to make a pull request, check this link:
https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/creating-a-pull-request

To contribute to this project you must add your name and your GitHub account to the array of contributors
declared in printer.js

Follow this example:

```
  const contributors = [
    { name: "Didier Valdez", github: "https://github.com/xDidier901" },
    { name: "Your name here", github: "your GitHub account link here" },
  ];
```

I'll try to update it everyday during the period of the HacktoberFest event

# Try new things
This is a fun place to get started contributing to open source projects.
Try to play with this project! 
Add css styles, hover effects, images, new ways to show the contributors, etc!
